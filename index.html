                                <p>When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, they're on TV! Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. Brace yourselves gentlemen. According to the gas chromatograph, the secret ingredient is… Love!? Who's been screwing with this thing?</p>
                                <p>How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city!</p>

They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!</p>

Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it. Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.</p>
