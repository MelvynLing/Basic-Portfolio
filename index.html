                                <p>I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the 
                                    three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business. Fat Tony is 
                                    a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer?</p>
                                <p>When will I learn? The answers to life's problems aren't at the bottom of a bottle, 
                                    they're on TV! Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. 
                                    Brace yourselves gentlemen. According to the gas chromatograph, the secret ingredient 
                                    is… Love!? Who's been screwing with this thing?</p>
                                <p>How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons 
                                    at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I 
                                    took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody 
                                    laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and 
                                    laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze. Can't you people take the law into 
                                    your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city!</p>
                                <p>I've done everything the Bible says — even the stuff that contradicts the other stuff! 
                                    Thank you, steal again. Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, 
                                    you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna 
                                    drink another woman!</p>
                                <p>Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2. Facts are meaningless. You could use 
                                    facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! Oh, everything looks bad if you 
                                    remember it. Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? 
                                    Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.</p>
